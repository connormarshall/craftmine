# craftmine
A browser-based minecraft clone developed with Three.js

## How to run

1. Run it on an HTTP development server. I use atom-live-server, but any is usable.
2. Open localhost:3000 on your browser of choice.
3. (OPTIONAL) Access it from a different device by running ngrok to expose ports. Ngrok can be downloaded via npm, and run with the command 'ngrok http 3000'
